In this project, we focused on enhancing the Random Forest algorithm by incorporating SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The research demonstrates how SMOTE improves the performance of Random Forest through various results and metrics.

-PowerPoint Presentation: Detailed insights into our research, including the impact of SMOTE on Random Forest.
-Datasets: Selected datasets used for testing.
-Metrics: Individual metric results available in the datasets_notebook_printed directory.
